# ImageRekognitionApp
User: The process begins with the user interacting with the system, presumably to upload an image or to request image processing.

Web Server: The web server acts as the entry point for the user's request. This server could be running on an Amazon EC2 instance or might be a service like AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

API Gateway: The request from the user is then routed through Amazon API Gateway, which acts as a managed service making it easier to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs.

Lambda Function: API Gateway triggers an AWS Lambda function. Lambda allows running code without provisioning or managing servers and is a key component in serverless architectures.

S3 Bucket: The Lambda function can interact with an Amazon S3 bucket, where the images are stored.

SNS Topic: After an image is uploaded to the S3 bucket, a notification is published to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) topic.

SQS Queue: The SNS topic sends the notification to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) queue. This decouples the process and allows handling of the messages at scale.

Recognition Stack: The architecture features a recognition stack, which likely uses Amazon Rekognition for image analysis.

Lambda Function: Another Lambda function is involved in this stack. It might retrieve the message from the SQS queue and send the image to Amazon Rekognition for processing.

Amazon Rekognition: The service identifies objects, people, text, scenes, and activities in images and videos, as well as detects any inappropriate content.

DynamoDB Table: After the image is processed, the results could be stored in an Amazon DynamoDB table, a managed NoSQL database service.

Third-Party Server: There's also a third-party server involved in the integration stack. Its role is not specified, but it could be for additional processing or integration with other systems.

Integration Stack: This likely involves integrating the core system with external systems or services, as mentioned with the third-party server.
